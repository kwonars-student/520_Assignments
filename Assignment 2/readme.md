## Parameter Descriptions

- **max_elements** = 20:

  - If the number of elements is too large, the program may experience performance issues.
  
- **resolution** = 2: 
  - This parameter specifies the resolution used in processing.
  - A lower value may provide more detailed results but will require more processing time.

## Usage

1. Set the `max_elements` to the desired value, ensuring it is not too large.
2. Adjust the `resolution` according to your preference.
3. Ensure that the `TestEnv.csv` file is present in the project folder.
